# **Lab 1: Build a plan and canvas app** **for a real estate solution with Copilot in Power Apps**

**Objective**: In this lab, you will use Copilot in Power Apps to design
and implement a real estate solution. You will create a structured plan
that defines business requirements, processes, data tables, and
technology components, and then generate a canvas app that surfaces and
manages real estate showings.

**Note**: This lab includes steps to create a plan which is a Copilot first development tool. Your results may be similar but not identical, as Copilot’s outputs can vary. In that case, use this lab as a reference or guideline. For example, if this lab works with a step called “Showing table” but your generated plan does not include that exact item, look for a similar step or equivalent action.

## **Exercise 1: Create a plan**

1.  Sign in to Power Apps at !!https://make.powerapps.com/!! with your
    Office 365 tenant credentials.

2.  Ensure that you are in your developer environment - **Dev One**. If
    not, click on the environment selector and select **Dev One**.

    based on your description. Review the user roles and needs.
    Select **"Looks good "** to move to the next step and generate a
    data model.

9.  The processing agent has generated a set of processes. Here, the
    processing agent has generated the **Manage Real Estate Showings**
    process. In your case, the process name can differ.

     **Summary**: In this lab, you learnt to build a real estate showing
     management solution. You created a plan in the Power Apps portal,
     where Copilot analyzes a business prompt to identify user roles,
     processes, and data requirements. You learnt to review and refine the
     generated data model, including validating and updating table columns
     such as the Status choice field in the Showing table and created a
     **canvas app** directly from the generated plan.
