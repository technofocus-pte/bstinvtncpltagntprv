     **Note**:
    
    - If the email is already connected to an opportunity, it's selected by
      default.
    
    - If no opportunity is connected, the top-ranked opportunity, which is
      determined by the open opportunities available for the account or
      contact, and the content of the email, will be selected by default.
    
    - When you search for a record, the search results display the record
      name and the key fields selected by your administrator.
    
    - Your search results will be added to the suggested records list, so
      you can safely search and try again.
